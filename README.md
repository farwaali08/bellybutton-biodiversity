# bellybutton-biodiversity

## OVERVIEW

For this project, an interactive dashboard was created to visualize data regarding the composition of navel bacteria for various test subjects. Users may select a test subject from the drop-down menu to learn more information about the individual, which ranges from basic demographics to the frequency in which their navel is cleaned.

The deployed webpage can be accessed [here](https://farwaali08.github.io/bellybutton-biodiversity/).
